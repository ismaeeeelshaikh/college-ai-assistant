APSIT PLACEMENTS INFORMATION AND TESTIMONIALS

=== RECRUITER TESTIMONIALS ===

Dharmendra Kumar, Senior Associate HR at TCS:
"A. P. Shah Institute of Technology is one of the best institutes in Mumbai. The students from APSIT are hardworking and sincere. Any recruiter is looking for three basic qualities in a student - technical know-how, discipline, and adaptability. Students from APSIT possess these qualities, which makes them an employer's choice."

Mannan Bobde, Campus Recruiter at CAPGEMINI:
"It's been said you should have something extra with your academics when you are a graduate. APSIT has an ample number of certification opportunities & MOUs signed with global brands and universities to make its students stand out from the crowd."

Craig Francis, West Region Head HR at WIPRO:
"The college has always welcomed Wipro with open arms and has left no stone unturned in making our hiring initiatives a success in the Mumbai region. A special mention must be made about the college's modern and sophisticated infrastructure. The college strives to ensure that its students have access to the latest technology. I also appreciate the efforts taken by Mr. Faisal Khan, TPO, APSIT."

Manish Singh, Senior HR at INFOSYS:
"First and foremost, I would like to say is the infrastructure to conduct a huge Maharashtra-level pooled drive for technical & non-technical students. The students of A.P. Shah have not just exceptionally supported such kind of drives but also actively participated and bagged offers. The placement team is well-trained & has a proper connect with a huge pool of candidates. The quality of students is really good based on my encounter with them and looking at their holistic approach."
